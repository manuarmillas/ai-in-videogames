# AI in Videogames: Deep Reinforcement Learning

The objective of this project has been to develop a Unity3D video game that works with
Deep Reinforcement Learning (a subbranch of machine learning that combines
reinforcement learning and deep learning), making use of Unity's ML Agents library for
training agents.

Throughout the project we will comment on each of the games developed (see README.pdf), explaining its
operation and objective and emphasizing the tools used and the agent's coding.
